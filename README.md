### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Stan! Nice to meet you, how's it hangin'?

I have been programming professionally for over 6 years now. I have a Bachelor in IT and have been freelancing and building my own products since 2017. I mainly work with Python and Django.

Some of my own projects:

:sunny: **ChiefOnboarding**

Back in 2017, I found ChiefOnboarding which is an open source employee onboarding platform (with a deep Slack integration). This initially started off as a closed source SaaS business, but a few years later I made everything open source so it would be easy to self-host and more accessible to companies.

:sunny: **Django-q2**

Since September 2022, I have maintained a fork of [django-q](https://github.com/Koed00/django-q). Django-q2 is a background worker for Django. It allows you to create async tasks and schedule background tasks at specific times. 

Django-q unfortunately got unmaintained and since I am using this library quite a bit, I forked it and now maintain the new version. It is available through pypi.

:sunny: **Djangowaves**

This is a personal blog of mine dedicated to Django which gets roughly 10k visitors per month. I have also released a course about using Django and VueJS together.

I often do consulting/freelancing (long and short term contract work). I can set up completely new projects from idea to launch (and beyond), but am also comfortable working within a team on specific issues or features. I highly value well tested and well documented code.

If you would like to work on something with me, then shoot me an email through my contact form: https://djangowaves.com/contact/.
